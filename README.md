# MultiplyMe

A math practise app mainly developed for practising multiplication tables. This was a private project of mine from december 2021/january 2022 that I turned into a public repo and released on google play. It is also one of my first flutter projects and has (as of march 2023) not the most optimized codebase. Feel free to create a fork and expand the project to your own liking. 

## Imprint
Since it is required by german law to create an imprint for any website or app, this app contains an entry for that in the settings. To avoid checking in personal data in a public repository, the app loads a markdown file from `assets/imprint.md` that is excluded through the `.gitignore`. You have to add an `imprint.md` file with at least one character, otherwise the app will not compile.
