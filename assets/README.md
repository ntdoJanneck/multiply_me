# assets
The assets folder in multiply_me is currently only used to house a markdown file containing the imprint for your app (`assets/imprint.md`). The imprint has to contain various information such as a full name, address, E-Mail address and/or phone number. This is required by German law for any website or app on a digital marketplace, which is why this file has to be here. When building the app, the imprint is included as an asset and its content is shown under Settings -> Imprint in the app. The file is not included in the git repository, to avoid checking in personal data. The `assets/imprint.md` file **has to** be here though, otherwise the app won't build!
